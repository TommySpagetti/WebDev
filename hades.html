                    <p style="padding-bottom: 30px;">Hades is a rogue-like dungeon crawler that could be argued to be almost identical in genre with previously mentioned video game (Enter the Gungeon). Unlike the previous game, Hades is quite straight forward in terms of gameplay and story. But that doesn't mean this game is less challenging. That's where Theseus from 3rd stage comes in. He is tough opponent on his own, but what makes him the more challenging is his partner Asterius the Minotaur will also fight alongside him with his own individual health bar. If you manage to fend of both of them and fell on of them either it be Theseus or Asterius, the one standing alive will become enraged, moving and attacking at a faster rate. Additionally, if you reduce Theseus to half health he will become briefly invulnerable and enter his second phase.</p>
