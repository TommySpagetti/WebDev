                    <p id="king">Dark Souls 3 is the latest soulsborne game of the Dark Souls trilogy. Fundamentally, it is practically almost similar to Sekiro. The key difference being the overall tone of the game, and having more restricted movement than Sekiro, since it's medieval times inspired it has more heavy notes. The hardest boss I encountered in which most people who probably played it as well would agree is Nameless King. The interesting thing abbout him is he is not mandatory boss to progress through the story. The only reason people would face him is either challenging themselves or getting his sick weapons and outfits in which probably is the case. Like most of the difficult bosses I mentioned, he has multiple phases. Fortunately, he only has 2 phases. But don't let it fool you. Finishing the first phase is already a very difficult task, since you'll be tasked to defeat a Lightning user who's riding a dragon. In the second phase you'll have to face him without the dragon. But without his mount he is more nimble. And, speaking from personal experience the second phase got me to take a break from the game for 3 months!! That should be enough to express how difficult the boss really is.</p>
